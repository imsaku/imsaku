Yo, people. My name (not real) is Saku. I'm a thirteen year old trying to make the next big thing.
Currently, the one most important project I'm actively working on and developing is @meliveworks.
More on that on the meliveworks page.

Anyways - the main things that should be on a GH README.md:

I code in:

Javascript:
 - Node.JS
 - Express.JS
 - A bit of React.JS
 - A bit of Vue.JS
 - General JS.

Batch/PWSH scripts;

Arduino;

A bit of Java;

HTML, of course.

And no, I don't have any social media. Don't really like TikTok or that sort of data-swallowing stuff.

Contact Email:
Not Available. Old imsaku email was nuked, please check back for that later!
